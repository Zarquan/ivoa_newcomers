Abstract
slide#2
IVOA working group structure (simple)

1. Finding Neutrino data in the VO-registry

VO Registry
slides 4 .... 8 
Simple overview, registry is where users find out about data and services.

2. Retrieve neutrino data through a Cone Search –
ConeSearch
slide #10
first standard tha IVOA agreed on
simple cone on the sky, doies what it says on the box

3 Adding catalogue data to the neutrino candidates with TAP –

TAP upload
TopCat 'knows' what tables because of UCDs 
slides 12 .... 13


 5 Using DataLink
Using SAMP to launch applications based on metadata in the DataLink
slides 15 ... 19
-> Show SAMP Standard on Standards and Documents !
https://ivoa.net/documents/
https://ivoa.net/documents/SAMP/20120411/index.html
-> show Architecture diagram in the samp standard

From the publisher's perspective
Show simple VOTABLE from 

SELECT TOP 1 mainid, RAJ2000, DEJ2000 FROM twomass.data

VOTABLE is the format how we transport data between a server and a client, or (in case of SAMP) between two clients.

Here starts the work of the dataprovider! 
Show the relationship between FIELDs, column  names, ref to coordsys, ucd and units.
This is the core of the data exchange in the IVOA.

DM
Don't worry: 
You don't need to write XML, there are tools available to make this easier.
but a key part of the data provider role is to collect and curate this  metadata

Role of the data provider ....
Data discovery
How the to help the user find the data they want.
TopCat TAP service table window
column metadata, USDs etc

step before that, finding the service we want
searching for 'sdss'
what you get is a list of 570 tables in the VO that contain `sdss` in the table name or description

includes tables which contain a subset or crossmatches with 'sdss' data
change search to `sdss dr16` constrains the search and we get one result

what does a data provider need to provide to enable this kind of search

back to registry
slides 21 ... 23

can do the same for cone search
search for `sdss` is equally overwhelming
search for `sdss dr16` and it constrains the search and we get one result

How a standard is developed in a working group.

Show the table of standards (again)

The published version

The development version
https://ivoa.net/documents/ConeSearch/20200828/index.html
Updating the standard to bring it uo to date with 12 years of changes in the metadata  standards

PyVO
ObsCore
slides 25 ... 27

Final slide IVOA  process, invite everyone to join the discissions and contribute :-)
