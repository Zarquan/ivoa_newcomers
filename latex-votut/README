A LaTeX style to help writing VO tutorials.

Getting started
===============

(1) create your document in the svn, maybe somewhat like this:

	mkdir mytut
	svn import mytut https://svn.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/svn/edu/trunk/mutut
	rmdir mytut
	svn co mytut https://svn.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/svn/edu/trunk/mutut

-- change mytut to whatever short name (project_keyword form highly 
preferred) you choose.

(2) "soft-link" this directory by using svn:external

	cd mytut
	svn propset svn:externals "latex-votut https://svn.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/svn/edu/trunk/latex-votut" .
	svn update

-- the latex-votut name is important, it's currently hardcoded in the 
style file.


(3) create your language-dependent subdir and start hacking

	mkdir en
	cd en
	cp ../latex-votut/Makefile.template Makefile
	# (edit Makefile, set docname at least)
	cp ../latex-votut/template.tex mytut.tex
	svn propset  svn:ignore --file ../latex-votut/svn-ignore.txt .
	# (edit mytut.tex)
	make
	# watch mytut.pdf


What this style gives you
=========================
- uniform layout for all tutorials
- option \titlepicture{filename}: if set in preamble, image 'filename' is put below title
- fancy header on top:
  depending on option, there is a GAVO, EURO-VO or IVOA logo added in header;
  use \setlogo{img} to set your own img as logo.
  By default, it will have height=2em; redefine \headerlogo if you need 
  different options
- commands for common software (includes URL-link), e.g. \Simbad, \WIRR, see votutorial.sty;
  aligned with abstract-environment
- predefined styles for links, urls, sections etc.
- \goto to make a right-arrow for menu navigation
- \key to highlight keywords 
- \sql for sql-commands; \begin{sqlbox},\end{sqlbox} to enclose sql-entries;
  you can also use the listings-package to get syntax highlighting; for 
  an example with sql-syntax highlighting, see gavo_rave.
- a standardsinfo environment; it's a breakout box intended for short
  background infos about the underlying standards.  Mark up the standard
  names with \s{...}.
- \tutstep{purpose}, \resettutstep for marking up step-by-step
  instructions.
- an exercise environment that sets apart a little problem-type piece
  (typically, something to keep advanced students busy while everyone
  else trudges along).
- A cczero macro declaring your document public domain (intended for the
  last page)
- A onvott macro declaring your document is listed on VOTT.


Things you may want to set/redefine
===================================
- \iconscale (default: 0.7) to adjust size of icons included via \icon{}.
- \icondir: directory with icons, default: latex-votut/icons
- \logodir: directory with ivoa-logo etc., default: latex-votut
- maketitle
- geometry settings (if you prefer larger/smaller margins); adjust these BEFORE including votutorials-package! (otherwise header will be messed up)
   e.g.: 
      \usepackage[a4paper, top=2cm, bottom=2cm, left=2cm, right=2cm]{geometry}
      \usepackage[gavo]{votutorial}
- \titlepicture{filename}: set picture for \maketitle
- \setlogo{logoname}: set your own logo, if not defined via package option
- \headerlogo: use \includegraphics{\logoname} with custom options, if the default doesn't work for you
- \abstractname: default is set in the package ("What's this about"). Redefine, if desired.
- \fancyhead[LE,RO]{\@title}: replace @title by a prefered short title or \leftmark or whatever you prefer


Known issues
============
- \linespread set to 1.15
This gives a linespacing of 1.38 (default for 10pt: 1.2). However, it does not work if a linebreak is done manually with "\\" inside the enumeration/itemize environment. Any ideas how to fix this?
\openup 0.38em could work, but this fails within the abstract-environment for some reason.
Work-around: use \\[0.38ex] when inside enumeration/itemize environment or never use "\\"

- The image directories for logos (\logodir) and icons (\icondir) are hardwired in the style-file. Overwrite the definitions to define your own.
- titlepicture will be stretched to 0.8\textwidth. This is hard-wired in the package.
- Won't work with book- or letter-documentclasses, only article and report are supported.
- Needs twoside-option for articles, if fancyheader is used (e.g. with [gavo] option).
